# Credit Score Modelling Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a robust credit score model using various machine learning techniques. The goal is to predict the creditworthiness of individuals based on their financial history and other relevant factors.

## Folder Structure
The project is organized into the following folders:

- `data/`: Contains raw and processed datasets used for modeling.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and model development.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data cleaning, feature engineering, and model training.
- `models/`: Serialized models and related metadata.
- `reports/`: Generated reports and visualizations.
- `docs/`: Documentation and references.

## Progress Report
### Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Collected data from multiple sources including financial institutions and public datasets.
- Cleaned and preprocessed the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and relationships of key variables.

### Feature Engineering
- Created new features based on domain knowledge and data insights.
- Applied feature scaling and encoding techniques to prepare data for modeling.

### Model Development
- Developed baseline models using logistic regression and decision trees.
- Experimented with advanced models such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.
- Evaluated models using cross-validation and performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.

### Findings
- Identified key features that significantly impact credit scores, such as payment history, credit utilization, and length of credit history.
- Advanced models like XGBoost showed better performance compared to baseline models.
- Feature importance analysis revealed that payment history is the most critical factor in predicting credit scores.

## Next Steps
- Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the best-performing models.
- Implement model interpretability techniques to explain predictions.
- Deploy the final model and create an API for real-time credit score predictions.
- Document the entire process and findings in the `docs/` folder.

## Conclusion
Significant progress has been made in developing a credit score model. The project is on track, and the next steps involve model optimization and deployment.
## Model Performance Evaluation

### Accuracy Plots
The performance of the models was evaluated using accuracy plots generated from the `ml_model.ipynb` notebook. These plots provide a visual representation of how well each model performed during the training and validation phases.

#### Logistic Regression
The accuracy plot for the logistic regression model shows a steady increase in accuracy as the model learns from the data. The training accuracy converges to a high value, indicating that the model fits the training data well. However, the validation accuracy is slightly lower, suggesting that the model may be overfitting to the training data.



#### Random Forest
The random forest model shows a more balanced performance. Both training and validation accuracies are high and close to each other, suggesting that the model generalizes well. The ensemble nature of random forests helps in reducing overfitting and improving overall performance.



### Summary
The accuracy plots provide valuable insights into the performance of different models. While logistic regression and decision trees show signs of overfitting, ensemble methods like random forest, gradient boosting, and XGBoost demonstrate better generalization capabilities. XGBoost, in particular, stands out as the best-performing model, making it a strong candidate for further fine-tuning and deployment.

### Next Steps Based on Model Performance
- Focus on hyperparameter tuning for the XGBoost model to further enhance its performance.
- Investigate model interpretability techniques for XGBoost to understand the decision-making process.
- Compare the performance of XGBoost with other advanced models and ensemble techniques.
- Validate the final model on an independent test set to ensure robustness and reliability.

By leveraging the insights from the accuracy plots, we can make informed decisions on model selection and optimization, ultimately leading to a more accurate and reliable credit score prediction system.
